A Filter is also a program which is written in the form of attribute and which can be applied to method or class/controller.

Creating a Project Structure
-----------------------------

There are no strict rules for creating a project but it is very very important task as the entire team is going to work based on the created structure.

Normally a project structure is one time creation and repeated usage.

We normally target Enterprise applications and design our structure. Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Design etc are most followed methodologies in creating project.
(Normally It is a lead/PM task to create project structure)

Typically

- Presentation Layer
- Domain Core Layer
- Infrastructure Layer
- Application Layer

CORE -- done

Infrastructure
  - Repositories implementation is required -- Repositories
  - Context class is required - Data
  - Migrations are required - Migrations
