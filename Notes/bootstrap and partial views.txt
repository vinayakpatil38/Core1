Partial Views**
--------------

A Partial view is also a view with markup like any other view.
A Partial view is always used to render its markup inside another markup/view.**
(unlike a normal view renders as a full view/page)

Advantages of Partial Views:

- View Reusability can be achieved using Partial Views for instance instead of writing a large or fully filled content of view we can create multiple or smaller partial views and use them in one or more pages.

- with above approach we avoid rewriting of same code or duplicating of same code

- Another import use of partial view is for Ajax. Ajax Requires partial page outputs without overwriting the existing page content and this can be achieved using Partial Views in MVC.

- jQuery Ajax is undoubtedly recommended for MVC application but still MVC also has Ajax helpers to implement Ajax using s/s helper methods.

@Ajax.ActionLink() & @Ajax.BeginForm() are 2 methods provided for implementing ajax in MVC.
(Do not forget they require jquery ajax library)
