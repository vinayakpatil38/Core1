Bundling & Minification
------------------------

In todays web applications both these concepts are very very important

Both bundling and minification are techniques

Performance --> they improve the loading time of a page/application

Every browser has limitations:
  
- how many connections you can have for each domain/application ?
- js code files
- css files
....

Bundling : When we develop application we will be using many 3rd party nuget and other js packages which leads to adding lot of .js and .css files. In addition we also create .js and .css files.

Bundling is a process of combining multiple files into a single file - let it be .js, .css or anything.
			lib1.js - lib1.css
			lib2.js - lib2.css
			lib3.js - lib3.css
			lib4.js - lib4.css

the more no of files - more no of requests leading to page loading performance issues		
Bundling will bundle multiple files into single result into faster loading of page

ASP.NET MVC performs s/s bundling and how the files should be bundled during response is provided in bundleconfig.cs


where in MVC
- bundleconfig.cs

how to consume ?

    @Styles.Render("~/Content/css")                           -- css
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/modernizr")                    -- js


Minification:

Process of applying optimizations to existing code without compromizing on the existing functionality.

- such as removing spaces comments new lines etc

resulting in faster page loading/performance

BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = true;
