Security in Web Applications

- In web applications security is implemented at different levels
	- Transport Level Security
	- Web Server Level Security
	- Application Level Security
		- Authentication and Authorization

What is Authentication ?
  The process of verifying user credentials against the configured data sources and providing the token/identity is called as Authentication.

What is Authorization ?
   The process of allowing/denying a requested resource based on the identity/token is called as authorization.

Authentication + Authorization = Application Level Security

In ASP.NET MVC we had Forms Authentication Module for implementing authentication and authorization but starting from ASP.NET MVC 3+ FormsAuthentication is deprecated or closed and new Identity system is introduced by microsoft.
OWIN --> Open Web Interface

ASP.NET Identity is nuget package which simplifies the process of authentication and authorization.

What tasks we need to do ? How to do ? 
- user creation process
- change password
- forgot password
- login
- email might be included
- social networking login
- sms - 2 factor authentication

ASP.NET Identity has support for all the above 

Some(Many) projects demand for seperate implementations i.e other than Identity like JWT is one of the popular authentication/authorization token based system.

JWT -- JSON Web Token
